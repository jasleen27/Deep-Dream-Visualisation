# Deep-Dream-Visualisation

This project demonstrates how to create artistic visualizations using Google's Inception v3 pre-trained neural network. The core concept is to use gradient ascent to enhance specific features in an image, resulting in surreal and dream-like visual effects.

Features
1. Download and load Google's pre-trained Inception v3 model.
2. Generate a deep dream image by enhancing specific layers of the neural network.
3. Visualize the result using Matplotlib.

   
Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow 2.x
3. NumPy
4. PIL (Python Imaging Library)
5. Matplotlib
6. Requests (optional, for downloading)
